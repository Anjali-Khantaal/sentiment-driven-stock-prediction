# Sentiment-Driven Stock Price Prediction Using Advanced NLP Techniques

## Project Overview
In this project, you'll develop a sentiment analysis tool using advanced NLP models to analyze financial news headlines and predict short-term stock price movements. By leveraging transformer-based models like FinBERT, you can extract nuanced sentiment from finance-specific texts. You'll then correlate this sentiment with stock price data to explore potential predictive capabilities.

## Project Objectives

### Data Collection
- Fetch recent financial news headlines related to specific stocks.
- Obtain historical stock price data for the same period.

### Sentiment Analysis
- Utilize a pre-trained FinBERT model to analyze the sentiment of each headline.
- Classify sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

### Data Integration
- Merge sentiment scores with stock price data based on timestamps.

### Analysis & Visualization
- Analyze the correlation between sentiment and stock price movements.
- Visualize findings using graphs and charts.

### Strategy Simulation
- Simulate a simple trading strategy based on the sentiment analysis.
- Evaluate the performance of the strategy over a short period.
